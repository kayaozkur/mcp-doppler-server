   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-doppler-server.git
   cd mcp-doppler-server
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
- `feat: add support for Doppler webhooks`
- `fix: handle rate limiting errors properly`
- `docs: update Python client examples`
- `chore: bump dependencies`

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external API calls appropriately

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions
- Include examples for new features
- Keep documentation concise but comprehensive

# Example Claude Conversations with MCP Doppler Server

Once you have configured the MCP Doppler Server in Claude Desktop, you can have conversations like these:

## Basic Secret Management

**You**: "Can you list all my Doppler projects?"

**Claude**: I'll list all your Doppler projects for you.
- dev: Development project
- myapp: My Application
- api-service: API Service

**You**: "Show me the secrets in the myapp production environment"

**Claude**: Here are the secrets in myapp/production:
- DATABASE_URL
- REDIS_URL
- API_KEY
- JWT_SECRET
- STRIPE_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
... and 12 more

**You**: "Update the DATABASE_URL in staging to use the new database server at db.example.com"

**Claude**: I'll update the DATABASE_URL in the myapp/staging environment.
✓ Successfully updated DATABASE_URL in myapp/staging

## Environment Promotion

**You**: "Can you promote all the secrets from staging to production, but exclude any DEBUG or TEST variables?"

**Claude**: I'll promote secrets from staging to production, excluding DEBUG and TEST variables.
✓ Successfully promoted 18 secrets from myapp/staging to myapp/production
Excluded keys: DEBUG, TEST_MODE, TEST_API_KEY

## Service Token Creation

**You**: "I need a read-only service token for our CI/CD pipeline in production"

**Claude**: I'll create a read-only service token for your CI/CD pipeline.

Service token created successfully:
Token: dp.st.prod_xxxxxxxxxxxx...
Access: read-only

⚠️ Important: Save this token securely - it won't be shown again!

## Audit and Compliance

**You**: "Show me the recent activity logs for the myapp project"

**Claude**: Here are the recent activities for the myapp project:

- 2024-12-20 15:30:45: Modified secrets in production with 1 updated
- 2024-12-20 14:22:10: Created read-only service token ci-cd-pipeline
- 2024-12-20 13:15:33: Promoted 18 secrets from staging to production
- 2024-12-20 10:45:22: Modified secrets in staging with 3 added, 1 updated

## Secret Rotation

**You**: "Delete the old API keys that start with 'OLD_' from all environments"

**Claude**: I'll delete all secrets starting with 'OLD_' from each environment.

Deleted from development:
- OLD_API_KEY
- OLD_STRIPE_KEY

Deleted from staging:
- OLD_API_KEY

Deleted from production:
- OLD_API_KEY

✓ Successfully removed 4 old API keys across all environments

## Complex Queries

**You**: "Which environments have the STRIPE_API_KEY configured?"

**Claude**: Let me check which environments have STRIPE_API_KEY configured:

✓ development: STRIPE_API_KEY is present
✓ staging: STRIPE_API_KEY is present
✗ production: STRIPE_API_KEY is not configured

You'll need to add STRIPE_API_KEY to production before going live with payments.

## Best Practices

**You**: "Can you help me set up proper database URLs for all environments?"

**Claude**: I'll help you set up proper database URLs for each environment:

For development:
- Set DATABASE_URL to: postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp_dev
✓ Done

For staging:
- Set DATABASE_URL to: postgresql://staging-db.example.com:5432/myapp_staging
✓ Done

For production:
- Would you like me to set the production DATABASE_URL now? Please provide the connection string.

## Error Handling

**You**: "Update the SECRET_KEY in the testing environment"

**Claude**: I encountered an error: Failed to list secrets for myapp/testing

It seems the 'testing' configuration doesn't exist in the myapp project. The available configurations are:
- development
- staging
- production

Would you like me to update the SECRET_KEY in one of these environments instead?
